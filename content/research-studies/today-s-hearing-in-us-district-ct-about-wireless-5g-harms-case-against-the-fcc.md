According to [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196 "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196")[(18)30221-3/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30221-3/fulltext)today's levels of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation around the 1 GHz frequency band, which is mostly used for modern wireless communications, have increased from extremely low natural levels before the 1950s by about 10¹⁸ times (1,000,000,000,000,000,000 times);compared to the end of the 1980s, it has increased by about 10 ⁸ times (100,000,000 times) (see graph below)  
The case against the FCC challenges the FCC's current exposure limits for the public, which is 10 W/m2 for 30 minutes for frequencies 1.5 GHz and above, set in 1996 and protect only against thermal damage and disregard injuries that occur at non-thermal levels [https://mdsafetech.org/non-thermal-effects-2/](https://mdsafetech.org/non-thermal-effects-2/ "https://mdsafetech.org/non-thermal-effects-2/") 10 W/m2 is near the lowest line on the graph below (dark blue line).   
Forwarded below is an article covering today's hearing and below that is an article about the case and links to 11,000 pages of evidence of harm filed in the case.Hopefully the court will reach a decision quickly, ruling against the FCC.
