What follows is a brief illustration why we should want to pay attention to this discussion and support this initiative. It will not be technical; the experts specialize in this area and have 25 pages of coloured charts if you are interested? Yes it can be technical, but it can also be simple.

Here is the scenario that will unfold (we believe) if this technology is rolled out. Most of us currently have a cell phone which runs on 3G or 4G. We do not know which group of frequencies it operates on, and we don’t know what it does to us, if anything. This is a mystery to most. To our knowledge we have never seen the cell tower(s) that power it. They are around, but immediately distant. We don’t think about them really.

That said, the frequencies created from these towers exist, whether or not we own a cell phone. They travel large distances because of their frequency bands (larger). They do affect ‘energy sensitive’ people in a way that is experienced physically. Please see the video from South Africa in our 5G section for a greater understanding [http://c4st.org/electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-disorder/](http://c4st.org/electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-disorder/ "http://c4st.org/electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-disorder/").

5G frequencies are another matter. This technology has different frequencies (smaller) and do not travel far. As a result, in order for it to be effective, there will have to be transmission towers every **50 to 200 feet or so from every human, day and night:** think ‘microwave oven’ here. This technology will have to be available 24/7 everywhere so that we can have self-driving cars, automated houses, surveillance 24/7 that can describe what is going on in your home at all times, etc. Smart meters were the beginning of this type of experience.

You will not need to own a cell phone or self-driving car to be impacted. We will all be impacted. We trust that the picture of this possibility is clear enough. Now imagine that all of life is composed of resonate frequencies…..energy! Imagine that all the birds, bees, flowers, trees, your children, grandchildren, and yourself, are just frequencies that have a consciousness. We are energy conscious beings to our very core ([https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/richard-jackman/the-energy-connection/paperback/product-14m98zpm.html?page=1&pageSize=4](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/richard-jackman/the-energy-connection/paperback/product-14m98zpm.html?page=1&pageSize=4 "https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/richard-jackman/the-energy-connection/paperback/product-14m98zpm.html?page=1&pageSize=4")). Yet we have never been told or taught this fact. We think we are merely ‘physical beings’, when in fact we are ‘energy beings’ living in a physical-like reality .

There is a book, initially published in 1996, entitled ‘The Conscious Mind’, written by David Chalmers (link here to article) which describes the concept of how we are frequencies governed by a form of consciousness. Now imagine that your field(s) (yes we have fields) are impacted 24/7 by 5G frequencies that mess around with those fields. The short story is that ultimately our wellbeing is determined by the resonance of those frequencies and fields, and its consciousness. Once they are altered, we are physically altered.

Please take the time to read the short summary of ‘The Conscious Mind’ and consider investigating this site and its contents. This may sound like a Science fiction movie theme, but it is not. It is time we all took responsibility for our ‘energy/energetic’ future. If you are interested in learning more let us know. Please help us raise the funds to challenge the Federal Government to start effective scientific experiments that will educate and protect everyone. Thanks!
